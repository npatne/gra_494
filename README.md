# Mid-Term Project Design Agency Landing Page

## Project Description

This project is a landing page for a hypothetical design agency named "Design Systems." It serves as a demonstration of basic HTML structure and JavaScript functionality to implement a lightbox feature. The landing page introduces the concept of Design Systems as a service and showcases the agency's brand.

## HTML Semantics and Accessibility Compliance

- **HTML Structure**: The HTML is structured using semantic elements like `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, and `<main>` for better accessibility and SEO.
  
- **Alt Attributes**: All images include descriptive alt attributes to ensure accessibility for users with screen readers.

## CSS File Structure and Capabilities

### Framework Inspiration:
- The CSS framework is inspired by Bootstrap, focusing on visual aspects, color schemes, and typography systems.

### Color System:
- The color system includes predefined variables for primary, secondary, and grayscale shades to ensure consistency across the design.

### Typography:
- Utilizes the 'Inter' font family from Google Fonts with various weights for different text elements.

### Responsive Design:
- The current version lacks responsiveness but is designed with responsiveness in mind for future implementation.

### Components and Utility Classes:
- Provides utility classes for flexbox, margin, padding, and display properties to streamline styling.
