        Text Elements. There are normal body texts with variants in terms of weight, size and customizations but there are specific elements created to serve semantic and aesthetic purposes in the application. Coding wise there are normal span elements with standardized CSS, to create labels, markers, headings, titles ets. All are accompanied by appropriate class names, IDs, aria-roles and aria-labels to satisfy ADA compliances.
